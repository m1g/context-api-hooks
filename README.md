# React Context API with React Hooks

A code along from the [Net Ninja tutorial][nnt] covering how to use the Context Api with Hooks

## Notes
- This uses react functional components instead of classes
- The `context-api without hooks` commit completes through lesson 8 (no hooks implementation)
- The last commit will have the complete tutorial with hooks

## Setup

Install the dependencies with npm and run the application

```
npm install && npm start
```
